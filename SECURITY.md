# Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please open a private vulnerability report at https://github.com/MengXi-Studio/uni-router/security/policy.

While the discovery of new vulnerabilities is rare, we also recommend always using the latest versions of Uni-App and its official plugins to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.
